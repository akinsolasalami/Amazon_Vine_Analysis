# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
I was tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. 

Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. I utilized PySpark and SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

* __36.22%__ of the Vine reviews were 5-stars

* __47.01%__ of the non-Vine reviews were 5-stars

## Summary
From our analysis, there is not a bias towards the Vine (paid) reviews. From the 613 paid reviews only 222 were 5-star which is around 36%. There were more unpaid reviews and a higher percentage of those reviews were 5-star. Hence, it is not worth to pay for the reviews. There is no bias. 

An additional analysis would be to seprate the different products and see how the vine reviews affect different wireless products. Some wireless devices might be more susceptible to advertising and paid reviews.
